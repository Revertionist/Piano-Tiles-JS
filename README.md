Piano tiles Game

Game Logic

    • A random tile of the grid should light up (or any other effects).
    • If the user clicks on the correct tile, it should proceed to the next round where along with the last round's tiles, one more tile should light up sequentially.
    • This should continue until the user clicks on one of the wrong tiles or till all tiles of the grid are used.
